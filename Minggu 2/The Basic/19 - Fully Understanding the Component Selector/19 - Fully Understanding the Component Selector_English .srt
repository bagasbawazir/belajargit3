1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,440
Now are you already a component ninja.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,820
We learned a lot about components about the templates options we have there and about the styles I want

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,480
and focus on the last property we see in this component decorator for now.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,310
The selector I already mentioned that this has to be a unique selector so that you don't override accidentally

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,450
an already existing element or maybe a component made available by a number of third party package you

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,790
use in your project.

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,000
There's one other piece of information about the selector.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,430
Though you don't have to use this type of selector right now our selector is the same selector as we

9
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,840
use it in C..

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:57,210
As for selecting element so we have app server this year as the element and this is recognized by angular

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,050
because the selector we chose is app servers and this basically just looks how you use select elements

12
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,490
in C S S right.

13
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,950
We select the age tree element by just typing Atri here.

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:17,460
We select the app service element by just typing app service here.

15
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:26,840
So that actually works Legacy's as selector and therefore you are not limited to selecting by element.

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,620
You could put this into square brackets to use the attribute selector.

17
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:40,190
So in Zia's as you can select elements by attribute by enclosing that attribute in square brackets.

18
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,150
And now if you save this you would see that our app actually is broken because if we have a look at

19
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:56,670
the error message app servers it's an unknown element because now our code angler doesn't recognize

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,330
app service anymore because we changed the selector to be an attribute.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,220
So to make this work again we would have to comment this out or remove it and maybe add a div or any

22
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:15,120
other element a normal aged human element which has the app servers attribute now.

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,240
Now with days custom attribute added now.

24
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,170
Now the Eberts again because now angler's selects the element by attribute and not by the element itself

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,630
because we changed the selector and Navier alternative is to select by and I'm just going to comment

26
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,630
this out so that the code is still there for reference to select by class.

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,120
So with a dot at the beginning app servers again just like in C S S.

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,120
So here we can now select by class.

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,600
So let's add a new day of the year which has a class of app servers which we of course could now also

30
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,380
style.

31
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,240
But besides that it's also recognized by Engler as a selector which is why we still see the app.

32
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,460
Now these are all options you have.

33
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:12,330
As a side note selecting by ID won't work that's not supported by angular and all those pseudo selectors

34
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:19,170
like hover and so on also don't work and you typically use the elements style here.

35
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,750
App servers for components.

36
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,820
We will soon learn about directives.

37
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,920
Another feature where this is different.

38
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,360
But for components you typically create your own elements and therefore you don't use that style and

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,140
you don't use the attribute style.

40
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,530
Instead you use app Cirus like element but it is important to understand that you are not limited to

41
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:43,840
this.

42
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,750
And there might be use cases where you want to use a different selector
