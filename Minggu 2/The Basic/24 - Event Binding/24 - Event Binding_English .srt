00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:09,110
In last lectures we learn a lot about how we can use property binding and stringin jubilation to output

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,750
data in the template.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,160
Let's now react to events.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,010
For example we have a pattern here.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:20,090
And after two seconds this badness enabled so would be nice we could do something once we clicked the

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,890
button.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,470
Now I will soon show you how we can actually add a news server how we can add a new replication of our

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,920
server a selector of our server component to year.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,440
For now what I want to do is I want to output something.

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,180
I will remove this text here and instead here I want to output the value of a property or create this

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,060
property.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,680
And again you make more energy on it for now I will come back to this.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:55,660
I will name it Server creation status and initially able to set it to no server was created like this.

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,620
Now this property can be output wires string a tribulation server creation status.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,930
And I just told you I don't want to continue outputting data.

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,330
We want to listen to events.

17
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,720
So I promised it we'll do it.

18
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:16,360
I will add another method below here and I will name this method on create server d on at the beginning

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,750
to kind of make clear that this will be triggered from within my template.

20
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:26,830
You don't have to name it on something but it kind of makes it easier to understand who will call this

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,600
method.

22
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:33,370
Well the user will basically by doing something some event will call it that is what I want to symbolize

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,230
with that.

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,770
So if you're able to set the server creation status to server was created.

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,570
So the missing piece of course is to call this method.

26
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:50,340
And now here is where if when binding comes into play we want to listen to this click event here.

27
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,740
And typically you have the on click attribute on the HDMI element where you can now execute some Chalis

28
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,550
dropped code.

29
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,690
We won't use that with angler though.

30
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:08,800
Here we have the Sendak's angler offers us event binding which uses parentheses like property binding

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,800
used square brackets for events.

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,190
Parentheses are a signal that we're using when binding.

33
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,630
And here we have to specify the name of DBAN between the parentheses.

34
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:28,090
For example click and you can basically bind to all the events made available by the HDMI attribute.

35
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,740
You're placing us on.

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,600
So if you have on click on mouse enter you could bind to click mouse enter without the on at the beginning.

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,000
So we are blind to the click event.

38
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,070
And now between the quotation marks we put the code we want to execute.

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,290
Once this event occurs not oftentimes you will call a method here.

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:58,690
So let's do it as LEDs point to the method we want to execute which is on create server with parentheses.

41
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,830
So this method will now get executed whenever we click the button.

42
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,390
As a side note you don't have to execute a method here.

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,140
You could also put the code you want to execute right between quotation marks.

44
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:18,100
Oftentimes this is not very good because you want to execute more code if some event happens.

45
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,510
But if all you want to do is set some boolean property to True for example well.

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:30,100
You can definitely do inline the template as a general rule though you shouldn't put too much logic

47
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,200
into your templates though.

48
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:39,270
So now we're binding to click event and we execute on create server method when it occurs.

49
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,090
So let's see there's an action in our application.

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,470
Let's reload the page.

51
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,530
The button gets enabled and now watch this part here.

52
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,620
So I click the button it changes the server was created because we are triggering our own methods here.

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,270
And this is how a simple event binding works.

54
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,870
Use parentheses.

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,910
Event name in between and then between the quotation marks the code you want to execute.

56
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,580
When this event occurs
